## Welcome to IsEtnaDown.com

[isetnadown.com](https://isetnadown.com) is a website which aims to provide easy monitoring and observability for [ETNA](https://etna.io)'s services.

It was a simple project answering to this question: "is the intranet down for you too?"

### The situation

As you might have noticed, the grafana interface providing insights about the uptime of the differents services has been down since the 25th of September 2020.

I happened to run out of credits, and do not wish to pay real money for this server.

I enjoyed putting this up, and it looks like some people liked the idea of a third-party monitoring service for our school.

## Thanks

- Thanks to [MontPt](https://github.com/Monpt7) for the domain name
- Thanks to [ETNA](https://etna.io/) for giving me an interesting issue to address
- Thanks to [Doom](https://github.com/doom/) for being so supportive

### What you can do for isetnadown.com

From now on, there are two options:
- either you run this website locally
- or you can contact me (using a github issue) if you want me to use your credits to make isetnadown great again

In any case, that was a really nice experience and I hope somebody will take care of this project when I'll be done with my studies.

Cheers,

_Bob_
